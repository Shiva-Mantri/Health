    - Side bends: While standing, place your hands on your waist and gently tip your torso to the right, then left. Slowly do this side bend several times.
    - Touch your toes: You can try touching your toes while seated in a chair, while standing, or while seated on the ground. While standing, slowly lower your head and try to touch your toes. Slightly bend your knees while doing this. You can also sit on the ground and extend your legs in front of you. Bend forward and reach for your toes.
    - Bring knee to chest: Lie on your back on the ground. Take one knee at a time and gently pull the knee towards your chest. Take turns with your other knee.
